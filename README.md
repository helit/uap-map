## What is this?

A world map of UAP/UFO marking out historical reports and sightings. The sightings are currently based from the list of sightings from the wikipedia page: [List of reported UFO sightings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reported_UFO_sightings).

This is just to have some kind of starting point. But more may be included.

I'm of course open to pull requests and requests in general to add reports and sightings. But I'd like them to be as high profile and based on as much evidence as possible, not random sightings from random people.

Also, I threw this together pretty quickly so feedback and suggestions on improvements and updates to the map is of course much welcomed.

## Why?

I made this site since I got a renewed interest in UFO/UAP because of the resent US congress hearings and whistleblowers coming forward.

I felt it would be interesting to see where the reported sightings where clustered to see some kind of pattern and searched for a good map but could only find kind of old and outdated maps. So I decided to make my own modern version.
